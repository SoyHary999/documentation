Explore provides a unified dashboard for monitoring your data, offering a quick and efficient way to identify and debug issues. Designed for investigating and analyzing large data volumes, Explore allows you to use filters, queries, and searches to pinpoint and delve into problems effortlessly.

### Simple / Lucene

Click on the dropdown menu to switch between Simple and Lucene query-based search:

* **Simple**: An intuitive search with auto-complete functionality. It streamlines your search process and enables faster access to data.

Build your query by selecting fields, parameters, and conditions. To add a value that doesn't appear in your logs, type its name and click on the + sign. You can also add free text to your search, which will convert it into a Lucene query.

<!-- ![Smart Search gif](https://dytvr9ot2sszz.cloudfront.net/logz-docs/explore-dashboard/simple-search-aug6.gif)-->

* **Lucene**: Use Lucene query language for log searches. You can search for free text by typing the text string you want to find; for example, `error` will return all words containing this string, and using quotation marks, `"error"`, will return only the specific word you're searching for.

### Filters

Filters make it easy to refine and narrow your search. Start by selecting the account you want to filter. Then, click on a field to see its available parameters. Choose the values to include in your view or uncheck to remove them.

All visible fields appear on the left side, including exceptions (if any) and special fields that cannot be filtered but can be added to the table or used as a **field exists** filter.


You can pin up to three custom fields by hovering over them and clicking the star icon.

### Graph View

Visualize trends over time and group data based on your investigations. Hover over the graph to see additional details about each data point, and click and drag to focus on specific time frames or data points.

You can enlarge or reduce the size of the graph by clicking the arrow button at the top right.

### Exceptions

Logz.io Exceptions automatically identifies and highlights exceptions in Explore.

You can see the number of exceptions detected for every query you run. Click the button to open the Exception quick view menu for a detailed view of the exceptions found.

Learn more about [Exceptions](https://docs.logz.io/docs/user-guide/explore/exceptions).

### Choose Time Frame

The default time frame in Explore is the last 15 minutes.

To select a custom time frame, click the time element and choose the period relevant to your overview or investigation.

### Observability IQ Assistant

Click the **AI Assistant** button to activate [Observability IQ Assistant](/docs/user-guide/observability/assistantiq), an AI-powered, chat-based interface that lets you engage in a dynamic conversation with your data. Use one of the pre-configured prompts or type your own question to get real-time insights about your metrics, anomalies, trends, and the overall health of your environment.

### Create Alert, Copy Link, Export CSV

The â‹® menu offers additional options for Explore, including:

* **Create Alert**: Opens the configure alert page with the current values and filters already added to the configuration
* **Copy Link**: Generates a URL with your current view, which you can share with team members. You need to be logged in to Logz.io to view it
* **Export CSV**: Exports up to 50,000 logs to a CSV file, including the timestamp and log message

### Logs Table

Use the Logs Table to view and analyze logs. Access relevant logs and their details quickly, customizing the table by adding or removing columns.

Expand each log to view additional details, see the log in JSON format, and add columns to the table. Filter values in or out of your view as needed. Use the Observability IQ Assistant on fields or values to gain more information about them. 

In the top right corner, choose to view a single log in a new window, view surrounding logs for context, and share the URL of the specific log you're viewing.
