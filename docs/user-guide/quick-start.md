## Send your data to Logz.io

Once you’ve set up your account, you can start sending your data.

Logz.io provides various tools, integrations, and methods to send data and monitor your Logs, Metrics, Traces, and SIEM.

The fastest and most seamless way to send your data is through our **Telemetry Collector**. It lets you easily configure your data-sending process by executing a single line of code, providing a complete observability platform to monitor and improve your logs, metrics, and traces.
